# Bioutils

Bioutils provides simple biological utilities ranging from complete iupac and quality character sets to checking sequence validity. Utilities provided are simple, although most are still evolving (make sure to specify a version if you use this crate, as we will introduce breaking changes).

<ul>Character sets include punctuation, are subdivided, and implemented in Rustâ€™s u8 rather than bitset</ul>

<ul>Traits and functions minimal algorithms and data structures outside rust standard Implementations are centered around u8, although character sets are also provided as &str, hashset u8 and hashset &str.</ul> 

<ul>Check back as more functionality gets added!</ul>
