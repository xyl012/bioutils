//! # Bioutils: Simple Biological Utilities with Rust's [u8]
//! Bioutils provides simple biological utilities ranging from complete iupac and quality character sets to checking sequence validity.
//! Utilities provided here are simple and built to be simple to call. Some key differences from rust-bio include:
//! * Character sets include punctuation, are subdivided, and implemented in Rust's [u8] rather than bitset
//! * Trait-based with minimal algorithms and data structures outside rust standard
//! Implementations are centered around [u8], although character sets are also provided as [&str], hashset u8 and hashset &str.
//! Check back as more functionality gets added!
//! ## Quick Start
//! ```
